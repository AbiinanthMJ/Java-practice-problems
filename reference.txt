1,the tail.next=n; says that the next in the head node points on the address of the next node so the link between them is created
2,Node is actually used to store address data
3,n the obj we created is actually the address

Table and memomization methods in
table is basically looping through array and where as bottom up is the method of recurison
-------------Combination and permutation----------------------
Combinators (combinations) deal with selection without order.

Different from permutations (where order matters).

search -> binary search --> o(log n )
sorting ->  merge sort --> n(log n )
freqcount  ->  HashMap --> o(1)
maximal subarray -> kadane's algoritham --> O(n)
maxtrix multi   -> strassins algoritham --> O(n^2.89)
string pattern  -> Kmp algo  --> O(n+m)
prefix sum
Two pointer  approach
Fast and slow pointer
Hashing techique --> O(1)
sliding window approach
Segment Tree -> Very important  --> Applications




-------------------------------Tree------------------------
Binary tree is inefficient if there is sorted data or values
where is it used ---?
Files systems
DataBases
Network Routing
Path finding algo
complex Mathematical problems
Decision Trees
Huffman coding
Future Datastructures
Binary Heap





PROPERTIES :
Size of the tree --> No of nodes is called the size of  Tree or the max number of edges
Right node and Left node are called --> Siblings
edge --> It is the line thats been connected in
Height --> it is the number of nodes thats been connected in between two nodes
        --> Max no of edges from the node and the leaf node
Leaf --> is the bottom nodes
Level --> subtract height of root - height of node
          height of root - height of node ==> 0
Ancestor --> Starting to the node which we find the path and the node which we start is called Ancestor & descendant


TYPES OF BINARY TREE :
1,Complete binary tree -> All the levels are full apart from the last level and fill it from the left to right
2,Full | strict binary tree  --> Each node has 0 or 2 children
3,Perfect binary tree --> All levels are filled
4,Height balanced binary tree -->O(log n )
5, Skewed binary tree --> Evey binary tree has a single child this is like linked list
6,Ordered binary tree --> Every node has a property


PROPERTIES What will help you in some problems
Perfect binary tree -> Total number of node ==> 2 ^ (n+1) -1
leaf nodes in perfect binary tree ==>  (2 ^ n)     n-height
Internal nodes inside the leaf node and the height or the root node  of the node is called --> Inside nodes => 2 ^ (n+1) -1- 2 ^ h
No of levels --> log(n+1)
no of leaf node in strict binary tree is N-1 | No of internal nodes + 1
In a binary tree the when we insert two number the  internal nodes +1 & Leaf node +1 (They will increase in same order)
No of Leaf node in a strict binary is equal to --> 1+ node of nodes two leaf nodes by excluding the root node

study.Implementation :
1, Linked representation
2, sequential using array
